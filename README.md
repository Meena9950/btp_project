Discription: 
Our project, "Super-Resolved Imaging with Multiple FMCW Radars," focused on aligning measurements from slave sensors with the master sensor's frame of reference to enhance radar imaging accuracy. By utilizing advanced neural network algorithms tailored for each slave sensor, we aimed to transform their perspectives to match that of the master sensor, creating a unified environmental model. This alignment process was crucial for combining data from various angles and distances into a singular, enhanced view, ultimately improving imaging capabilities and target estimation accuracy in radar systems.

Through our innovative approach, we aimed to pioneer advances in radar technology by optimizing the coordination between multiple sensors. The successful synchronization of slave sensor measurements with the master sensor's frame of reference has the potential to revolutionize multi-target estimation and imaging capabilities, promoting efficiency, safety, and scientific research in real-world applications. Our project's contribution lies in advancing radar technology to enhance resolution, accuracy, and productivity in radar-based imaging systems, thereby addressing the challenges of aligning sensor measurements to a common frame of reference for improved performance.
